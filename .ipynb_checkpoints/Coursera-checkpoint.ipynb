If a resident in one city wants to relocate to different city or neighbourhood, which city/neighbourhood should he choose that is most similar to his current neighbourhood. This project will try to answer this question. We will base our similarity on a kind of Blueprint for neighbourhoods based on popular venues such as Restaurants, Malls, Natural Areas, Tourist Destinations etc.\n",
